http
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol used for transferring data, including web pages and other content, over the internet.

 A web address, also known as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), is a unique identifier that defines the location of a particular web page or resource on the internet. It is used to locate and access a specific resource on a web server by entering it into a web browser.

 Great, thank you for providing that context! DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a system used to translate domain names (e.g. google.com) into IP addresses (e.g. 172.21.1.1) that computers can understand. In other words, DNS is a way of mapping human-readable domain names to the numerical IP addresses that computers use to communicate with each other on the internet
 DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that helps translate human-readable domain names into the numerical IP addresses that computers use to communicate with each other on the internet.
  without DNS, you would have to enter the IP address `192.0.2.1` to access the website `google.com`. This is why DNS is an essential part of the internet infrastructure,

1. `http`: This is the protocol used for transferring data over the internet.

5. `8080`: This is the port number used to communicate with the server.
6. `maps`: This is the path or resource being requested.
7. `sort=rank`: This is a query parameter used to sort the results in a specific order. In this case, the results are being sorted by rank.
8. `#id`: This is a fragment identifier used to specify a specific section of the page to be displayed. In this case, the fragment identifier is `#id`, which means that the page should display the results sorted by rank, and the specific section of the page to be displayed is the `id` of the element.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
